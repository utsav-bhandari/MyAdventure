## MyAdventure

NOTE: I made this only with the IntelliJ IDE in mind. If your terminal doesn't support ANSI colors, it's going to look weird at points.

__To run the game, you simply need the java files in src and the stlib.jar library__

The .iml has some junit things in there, which I'm not sure how to remove but that is definitely not required.

This is a very sloppy and rushed side-project I did (also my first one using Java, so it's all over the place).
Due to time constraints, I couldn't follow the best possible coding practices and the code is not that pretty.
I could've also moved all the bulky text printing to Util and made the code shorter than it is but oh well.
