## MyAdventure

NOTE: I made this only with the IntelliJ IDE in mind. If your terminal doesn't support ANSI colors, it's going to look weird at points.

__To run the game, you simply need the java files in src and the stlib.jar library. It was built using java version 21.0.2__

__The .iml has some junit things in there, which I'm not sure how to remove but that is definitely not required.__

This is a very sloppy and rushed side-project I did (also my first one using Java, so it's all over the place).
Due to time constraints, I couldn't follow the best possible coding practices and the code is not that pretty.
Lots of methods can be extracted and logic abstracted to make the code more readable but oh well.
There might still be a invisible bug where the dice roll does not happen. I could not replicate it so that's that I guess.
